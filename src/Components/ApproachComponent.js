              As a therapist, I value and create a safe, nurturing, and empathic
              environment for individuals, couples, and families to explore
              underlying issues to relationship problems, depression, anxiety,
              grief and loss, and abuse of substances. I am trained in EMDR,
              which helps a person to quickly move through recent and past
              trauma and successfully overcome symptoms related to PTSD (post
              traumatic stress disorder). We'll work together to help you find a
              healthy balance between body, mind, and emotions that allow for
              success in relationships and work, self-empowerment, and to live a
              life full of hope, meaning, and purpose.
